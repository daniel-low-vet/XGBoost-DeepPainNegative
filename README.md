## Machine-learning-based prediction of functional recovery in deep-pain-negative dogs after decompressive thoracolumbar hemilaminectomy for acute intervertebral disc extrusion
Overview
* This repository contains the code and trained XGBoost model for the above study.
* The open-access paper is available at [doi.org/10.1111/vsu.14250](https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.14250)

Model

* The XGBoost classifier was trained on the dataset with Bayesian hyperparameter optimisation to predict postoperative ambulation recovery.
* Best XGBoost hyperparameters: {'learning_rate': 0.004835563568734652,
'max_depth': 6, 'n_estimators': 2284, 'min_child_weight': 3,
'subsample': 0.7718650742894587, 'colsample_bytree':
0.8734927796575177}
